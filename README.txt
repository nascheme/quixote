Quixote
=======

Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications in Python.
The target is web applications that are developed and maintained by
Python programmers.  See http://quixote.ca/users for a list of some
applications using Quixote.

For installation instructions, see the doc/INSTALL.txt file.  For
the impatient, install the package using setup.py and then run:

    python quixote/demo/mini_demo.py

Note that you can copy the mini_demo.py somewhere and use it as a
starting point for your application if you like.  See the Quixote
wiki page <http://quixote.ca/qx/MiniDemo> for more hints.

Documentation is available in the doc/ directory and on the Quixote
web site.

Quixote includes PTL, the Python Template Language for producing
HTML with Python code.  Note that the use of PTL is not required in
Quixote applications.  Details about PTL are provided in
doc/PTL.txt.
